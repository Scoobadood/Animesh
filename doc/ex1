Experiment One


Background:

Where two surfels are connecte by an edge in the SurfelGraph, it means that they are 'neighbours' in at least one frame.

They may be neighbours in multiple frames.

If we smooth the same neighbour across multiple temporal frames, we introduce more variance intp the final orientation of the cross field than may be helpful.

So we should only smooth for one frame.

Choices are:
Compute best for all frames
Compute most divergent for all frames
Pick one at random
Pick the first

Hypothesis:
Picking the closest will lead to better convergence or faster convergence.

Test:
Construct a test with 7 frames
Run with a hierarchy = no, 10 iterations
Establish baseline values for four nodes at random

Dump results for a specific node
Turn on the flag for best only smoothing
Run again
